# Code-of-Lake-salinization-leads-to-thresholds-of-diversity-change
This is a description of the code used in my study "Salinity thresholds shape global patterns of freshwater biodiversity". In this section I detail all the code used in the analysis, as well as the relevant data. 
A total of five parts of the content, corresponding to five different documents, any questions please contact the emali:

Part1_Effect-controlled diversity calculation;

Part2_Location of lakes used in the paper;

Part3_Spearman correlation analysis and random forest model;

Part4_Detect possible thresholds of macroinvertebrate diversity;

Part5_Beta diversity analysis and relative abundance of various groups.

All lake environmental and macroinvertebrate biodiversity summary data compiled in this study are deposited in Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28828817.v4). 
The dataset includes lake-level environmental variables, diversity metrics adjusted for sampling effort, and species abundance distributions.
